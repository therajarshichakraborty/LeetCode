Hint
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. Note that "bca" and "cab" are also correct answers.
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        int maxLength = 0;
        HashSet<Character> charSet = new HashSet<Character>();

        for (j = 0; j < s.length(); j++) {
            while (charSet.contains(s.charAt(j))) {
                charSet.remove(s.charAt(i));
                i++;
            }

            charSet.add(s.charAt(j));
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, j - i + 1);
        }
        return maxLength;

    }
}
