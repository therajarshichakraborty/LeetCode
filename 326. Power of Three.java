Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return false.

An integer n is a power of three, if there exists an integer x such that n == 3x.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 27
Output: true
Explanation: 27 = 33
Example 2:

Input: n = 0
Output: false
Explanation: There is no x where 3x = 0.
Example 3:

Input: n = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no x where 3x = (-1).
 

Constraints:

-231 <= n <= 231 - 1
 

Follow up: Could you solve it without loops/recursion?
public class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfThree(int n) {
        int maxPowerOf3 = 1162261467; // 3^19 is the largest power of 3 in int range
        return n > 0 && maxPowerOf3 % n == 0;
    }
}
