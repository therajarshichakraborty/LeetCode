Hint
Given a binary string s and an integer k, return true if every binary code of length k is a substring of s. Otherwise, return false.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "00110110", k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: The binary codes of length 2 are "00", "01", "10" and "11". They can be all found as substrings at indices 0, 1, 3 and 2 respectively.
Example 2:

Input: s = "0110", k = 1
Output: true
Explanation: The binary codes of length 1 are "0" and "1", it is clear that both exist as a substring. 
Example 3:

Input: s = "0110", k = 2
Output: false
Explanation: The binary code "00" is of length 2 and does not exist in the array.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 5 * 105
s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
1 <= k <= 20class Solution {
    public boolean hasAllCodes(String s, int k) {
        int req = 1 << k;
        boolean[] seen = new boolean[req];
        int mask = req - 1;
        int hash = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i) {
            hash = ((hash << 1) & mask) | (s.charAt(i) & 1);

            if (i >= k - 1 && !seen[hash]) {
                seen[hash] = true;
                req--;
                if (req == 0) return true;
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
}
