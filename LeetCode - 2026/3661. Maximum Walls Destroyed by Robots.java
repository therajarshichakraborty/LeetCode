Hint
There is an endless straight line populated with some robots and walls. You are given integer arrays robots, distance, and walls:
robots[i] is the position of the ith robot.
distance[i] is the maximum distance the ith robot's bullet can travel.
walls[j] is the position of the jth wall.
Every robot has one bullet that can either fire to the left or the right at most distance[i] meters.

A bullet destroys every wall in its path that lies within its range. Robots are fixed obstacles: if a bullet hits another robot before reaching a wall, it immediately stops at that robot and cannot continue.

Return the maximum number of unique walls that can be destroyed by the robots.

Notes:

A wall and a robot may share the same position; the wall can be destroyed by the robot at that position.
Robots are not destroyed by bullets.
 

Example 1:

Input: robots = [4], distance = [3], walls = [1,10]

Output: 1

Explanation:

robots[0] = 4 fires left with distance[0] = 3, covering [1, 4] and destroys walls[0] = 1.
Thus, the answer is 1.
Example 2:

Input: robots = [10,2], distance = [5,1], walls = [5,2,7]

Output: 3

Explanation:

robots[0] = 10 fires left with distance[0] = 5, covering [5, 10] and destroys walls[0] = 5 and walls[2] = 7.
robots[1] = 2 fires left with distance[1] = 1, covering [1, 2] and destroys walls[1] = 2.
Thus, the answer is 3.
Example 3:
Input: robots = [1,2], distance = [100,1], walls = [10]

Output: 0

Explanation:

In this example, only robots[0] can reach the wall, but its shot to the right is blocked by robots[1]; thus the answer is 0.

 

Constraints:

1 <= robots.length == distance.length <= 105
1 <= walls.length <= 105
1 <= robots[i], walls[j] <= 109
1 <= distance[i] <= 105
All values in robots are unique
All values in walls are uniqueclass Solution {
