Hint
You are given a string s of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.

Return the smallest index i such that s[i] == s[n - i - 1].

If no such index exists, return -1.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcacbd"

Output: 1

Explanation:

At index i = 1, s[1] and s[5] are both 'b'.

No smaller index satisfies the condition, so the answer is 1.

Example 2:

Input: s = "abc"

Output: 1

Explanation:

​​​​​​​At index i = 1, the two compared positions coincide, so both characters are 'b'.

No smaller index satisfies the condition, so the answer is 1.

Example 3:

Input: s = "abcdab"

Output: -1

Explanation:

​​​​​​​For every index i, the characters at positions i and n - i - 1 are different.

Therefore, no valid index exists, so the answer is -1.class Solution {
    public int firstMatchingIndex(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(n-i-1)){
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
